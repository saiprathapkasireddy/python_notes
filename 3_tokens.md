# Tokens 

- Token is the smallest unit in a program. 
- The Python interpreter uses tokens to recognize and parse the source code.
- The interpreter uses these tokens to understand and execute the code provided. 
- There are several types of tokens in Python, each serving a different purpose.


## Different Types of Tokens:

### Keywords:
- Keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning in Python. 
- They cannot be used as variable names. 
- Examples `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, etc.

### Identifiers:
- Identifiers are used as names for variables, functions, classes, etc. 
- An identifier must start with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores.

```python
variable_name = 32
_name ="sai"

# variable_name and _name are identifiers to identify values.
```
### Operators:
- Operators perform operations on variables and values.
--------------------------------------- 
             Examples: arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, ``, `/`) 
                       comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`)
                       logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
      

### Delimiters
- Delimiters are characters used to define the structure of the code, such as parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`.

```python

li = [1,2,3]
tu = ("sai",2,7)
sets = {1,9,4}
obj = {"name":"Sai","gender":"male"}

# In the above [], (), {} are delimeters to pack elements.
```
### Comments:
- Comments are annotations in the code that are ignored by the interpreter. 
- They start with the `#` symbol and are used for documentation and clarification.

### Strings:
- Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes or triple qoutes (`'''` or `"""`).
      
```python 
message = "Hello, Python!"
name = 'sai'
language = '''python'''

# letters or characters in between quotes are called strings.
```
### Whitespace:
- Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and line breaks. 
- It is used to separate tokens and make the code readable.

```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
```
